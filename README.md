# 🌾 CropYieldAI: Predicting Agricultural Yield using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project presents a machine learning-based approach to **predict crop yields** using historical data on environmental and agricultural variables. The goal is to help **farmers, agricultural experts, and policymakers** make informed decisions for optimizing crop production and ensuring food security.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a predictive model for estimating crop yield using:
- ✅ Decision Tree Regression
- ✅ Random Forest Regression

The system leverages key agricultural factors such as:
- 🌧️ Rainfall
- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Irrigation
- 🧪 Fertilizer Usage
- 🧂 Macronutrient Levels (NPK)

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Cleaned raw agricultural datasets
- Handled missing values
- Performed feature encoding and normalization

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified patterns and trends in rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage
- Visualized feature correlations with crop yield

### 3. **Model Development**
- Built models using:
  - 🎯 Decision Tree Regressor
  - 🌲 Random Forest Regressor
- Compared model performance using:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### 4. **Results**
- **Random Forest** outperformed Decision Tree
- Achieved **R² score of 0.802**
- Most important features: **Temperature and Rainfall**
